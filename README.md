First, simply install the @biotope/preview package as any other regular npm package:
```bash
npm install https://github.com/biotope/biotope-preview.git --save
```

To create a preview folder for your biotope elements project, you need to add the following scripts to your project's package.json: 
```javascript
"storybook:build": "npm explore @biotope/preview -- npm run storybook:build",
"storybook:serve": "npm explore @biotope/preview -- npm run storybook:serve"
```

It parses your src/components/ subfolders for the component's package.json's and creates previews based on the configuration inside.
The following data is required for the process to work:

```javascript
{
    "name": "Stage",
    "tagName": "x-stage",
    "previewConfigs": [
        {
            "name": "Default",
            "props": {
                "text": {
                    "headline": "Stage",
                    "claim": "With a claim",
                    "secondaryColor": false
                },
                "image": {
                    "url": "https://picsum.photos/id/804/1000/600",
                    "alignment": "center",
                    "alignmentLarge": "center",
                    "altText": "Image"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
  ```

Now you need to run `npm run build` to compile your biotope project. Then you can run either `storybook:build` or `storybook:serve`. `storybook:build` will create a preview folder in your project with a index.html you can then open in a browser. `storybook:serve` will not create any folder, but only serve a temporary storybook preview.
